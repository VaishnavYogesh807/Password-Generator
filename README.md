# Password-Generator

**Description:**
  This project creates a password generator that can produce two types of passwords: Memorable & Random

**How to use:**
  The program asks the user which type of password they want.
  Memorable: The user is asked for the number of words and whether the words should be in title, upper, or lower case.
  Input Ex: (3, title)
  Result: Apple7-Train3-Cloud9
  
  Random: The user is asked for the number of characters, whether punctuation should be included, and if there are any characters that should not be used.
  Input Ex: (9, True, "0OLl")
  Result: aG7kP2!qZ

The program also records every generated password along with the exact date and time it was created. These passwords are automatically saved into files inside separate folders for memorable and random passwords.

Modules Used:
  Randomness
  String handling
  Time tracking
  File handling
